# Glucose Monitoring System

A Python application for monitoring glucose levels from Dexcom sensors, providing intelligent analysis, predictions, and recommendations to help manage diabetes. This is a fully vibe coded app and will contain a lot of emojis and other nonsense. But it works for me and has been very helpful.

My use-case is to reduce mental load while handling the glucose levels for my child. I love that a Telegram bot is helping me making decisions.
My goal is to trust this software to alert me and give valid recommendations. I do not want to look at the Omnipod active insulin and the current
value of the Dexcom and think about a solution.

One next step could be to integrate an LLM. But not sure of that really makes sense.

## Usage

### Basic Monitoring
```bash
# Start monitoring with real Dexcom data
python -m src.main

# Start with mock data for testing
python -m src.main --mock

# Specify custom configuration file
python -m src.main --env-file custom.env
```

### Run Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run specific test categories
pytest tests/test_recommendations.py -v
pytest tests/test_analysis.py -v

# Run tests with coverage
pytest --cov=src tests/
```

## How It Works

### 1. Data Collection
- Connects to Dexcom Share API using pydexcom library
- Retrieves new glucose readings every 5 minutes + 5 seconds
- Stores readings in SQLite database with timestamp and trend information

### 2. Analysis Engine
The system performs multi-layered analysis:

**Trend Analysis**
- Calculates rate of change (mg/dL per minute) using configurable thresholds
- Determines trend direction and strength with linear regression
- Assesses glucose stability using variance analysis

**IOB/COB Tracking**
- Tracks Insulin on Board using configurable insulin duration curves
- Monitors Carbs on Board with absorption time modeling  
- Supports manual IOB overrides from pump/Omnipod readings
- Calculates glucose impact predictions from active insulin/carbs

**Prediction Algorithms**
- Linear extrapolation for consistent trends
- Polynomial fitting for curved patterns
- Considers IOB/COB effects on future glucose levels
- Ensemble approach selecting best method with confidence scoring

### 3. Recommendation System

**Four Recommendation Types**:
1. **Carbohydrate Recommendations** (Priority 1) - For low/falling glucose
2. **Insulin Recommendations** (Priority 2) - For high/stable glucose  
3. **IOB Status Recommendations** (Priority 4) - To verify active insulin accuracy
4. **Monitoring Recommendations** (Priority 5) - Increased monitoring frequency

**IOB Status Recommendations** trigger when:
- Approaching low glucose without IOB data (High urgency)
- Glucose rising fast with no IOB data (Medium urgency)  
- High IOB (>0.6u) significantly affecting predictions (Medium urgency)
- Approaching low with existing IOB requiring verification (High urgency)

**Safety-First Design**:
- Conservative thresholds with configurable sensitivity
- Multiple safety checks including IOB consideration
- Clear contraindications (e.g., no insulin if trending down rapidly)

### 4. Telegram Integration
- Real-time bidirectional communication
- Plain number shortcuts for quick IOB entry (supports `2.4` and `2,4` formats)
- Rich command processing with parameter validation
- Formatted responses with safety notes and recommendations

## Message Examples

### IOB Status Recommendation
```
üîÑ IOB Status Check - 14:30

IMPORTANT: Check current IOB status - approaching low with 0.6u IOB - verify accuracy for safe predictions.

Current IOB: 0.6 units
Expected effect: 0.6u IOB should lower glucose by ~24 mg/dL

üí° Safety Notes:
‚Ä¢ Accurate IOB improves prediction accuracy
‚Ä¢ Check pump/Omnipod display for current active insulin  
‚Ä¢ Update using /iob command or plain number in Telegram
```

### Insulin Recommendation (IOB-Aware)
```
ü©∏ Glucose Alert - 14:30

Current: 220 mg/dL ‚¨ÜÔ∏è
Trend: Rising
IOB: 0.2 units (minimal impact)

üíâ Insulin Recommendation
Consider 0.7 units of rapid-acting insulin. Adjusted for current IOB.
‚Ä¢ Suggested: 0.7 units (reduced from 0.9u due to active insulin)

‚ö†Ô∏è Safety reminders:
‚Ä¢ Consult healthcare provider before administering insulin
‚Ä¢ Monitor glucose closely after insulin administration
```

### Quick IOB Update via Telegram
```
User: 2.4
Bot: ‚úÖ IOB Override Set

IOB updated to 2.4 units from telegram-shortcut
Expected glucose effect: -96 mg/dL over next 60 minutes
Last updated: 14:32
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Dexcom Connection Errors**
- Ensure Dexcom Follow is enabled in the Dexcom mobile app

```bash
# Test Dexcom connection  
python -c "from src.sensors import DexcomClient; from src.config import Settings; DexcomClient(Settings()).test_connection()"
```

**Telegram Bot Issues**
- Verify bot token and chat ID are correct
- Check that the bot has permission to send messages
- Test with simple commands first
```bash
# Test Telegram connection
python debug_telegram.py
```

**Configuration Issues**
```bash
# Validate configuration
python -c "from src.config import Settings; print(Settings().to_dict())"
```
